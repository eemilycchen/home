	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	<p>
	I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics, with a minor in Computer Science at the University of California San Diego. For four years as 
	a math instructor, I strived to be vigilant and inclusive to problem-solve mathematical problems and adapt to a wide diversity of students. 
	My studies fostered my passion in mathematics and evolved my direction toward artifical intelligence. My worldview and experiences empowers me to continue using mathematics and computer science to make a meaningful difference.

<h2>COURSES</h2>
<!-- Math courses -->
<p><b><i>Probability, Stochastic Processes I, Stochastic Processes II</i></b></p>
<p> This is a  three-course sequence. The first part covers key topics in probability theory including, conditional probability, independence, random
	variables, distributions, expectation, variance, Baye's Rule, Law of Total Probability, Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and Central Limit Theorem (CLT). 
	The second and the third part cover topics in distribution of martingale, random sums, Markov chain, n-step transition probability, successive maxima, one-dimensional random walks, 
	successive runs, branching process, Gambler's Ruin, limiting probability distribution, stationary distribution, recurrent and transient states, and Poisson process. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Exploratory Data Analysis, and Inference with Mathematical Statistics</i></b></p>
<p>
	This is a project-based course that uses Python modules and libraries to automate statistical inferences and create 2D and 3D visualizations. The topics that were covered
	were regression analysis for a single variable and multiple variables, interpretation of regression analysis and coefficients, diagnostics for normality and independence of residuals and heteroscedasticity,
	generalized hypothesis testing, (multinomial) logistic regression, variable selection using adjusted R squared, AIC, and BIC, cross-validation, and stepwise selection.
</p>
<p><b><i>Hidden Data in Random Matrices with Numerical Linear Algebra</i></b></p>
<p>
	This is a rigorous course that builds the understanding of the principal component analysis (PCA) using mathematical theories. It was completed with a final project to apply PCA to find signals among noisy, large datasets. The topics covered were singular value
	decomposition for matrices,  least squares method, affine subspaces, unbiased estimators, Wigner's semicircle law, and Marchenko-Pastur laws. This was course was taken after Numerical Linear Algebra, which cover topics in
	projections, orthogonality, eigendecomposition, and positive definite semisimple matrices, which I found to be helpful for theoretical connections.
</p>
<!-- Computer Science Courses -->
<p><b><i>Deep Learning</i></b></p>
<p>
	This was a competitive, project-based course. The topics covered were the fundamentals of deep neural networks such as linear regression, multi-layer perceptrons, backpropagation, automatic differentiation, convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks, 
	and transformers. 
</p>

<!-- Interdisciplinary Courses -->
<p><b><i>Data Science in Practice</i></b></p>
<p>
	This is a project-based course. The topics covered were presenting robust, clear visualizations using <code>seaborn</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>, applications of descriptive, exploratory, and inferential anlayses, non-parametric statistics, bootstrapping (resampling), sentiment analysis, TF-IDF, machine learning approaches (supervised vs unsupervised), train-validate-test sets, k-folds cross validation, 
	data processing and transformation using <code>scikit-learn</code>, feature engineering, searching for best hyperparameters, model selection, support vector machine (SVM), evaluating accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with confusion matrices, and geospatial analysis.

</p>
<p><b><i>Data Ethics</i></b></p>
<p>
This is a project-based course. There are three in quarter projects that targets a deeper understanding of ethical values along major intervention points of a data science effort. The course is completed with a final project as a summative effort. Topics covered include consequences of accepting the Neurality Thesis, problem defintion, values, data acquisition, privacy, consent: acts of consent, informed consent, and 
educated consent, and Goodhart's Law.
